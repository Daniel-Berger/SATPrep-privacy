# Privacy Policy

**SAT Prep - Vocab Flashcards**
**Effective Date:** February 24, 2026
**Developer:** Daniel Berger

## Overview

SAT Prep is designed with your privacy in mind. Your study data stays on your device, and we collect only minimal, anonymous usage data to improve the app.

## Data Stored on Your Device

All of your study progress is stored locally on your device using Apple's SwiftData framework. This includes:

- Flashcard progress and mastery levels
- Spaced repetition scheduling data (review dates, intervals)
- Notification preferences (reminder time settings)

This data is never uploaded to our servers. If you delete the app, this data is permanently removed.

## Analytics

We use Google Firebase Analytics to collect anonymous usage data such as which screens are visited and how features are used (for example, when a study session starts or completes). This helps us understand how the app is used so we can improve it.

Firebase Analytics does not collect personal identifiers like your name or email address. You can learn more about how Google handles analytics data at [Firebase Privacy](https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy).

## Feedback Submission

If you choose to submit feedback through Settings, the following information is sent to Firebase Firestore:

- Your feedback message, category, and rating
- App version and build number
- iOS version and device model
- A timestamp

Feedback submission is entirely voluntary. No personal identifiers such as your name or email address are collected with feedback.

## What We Do Not Collect

- No names, email addresses, or account information (the app has no sign-in)
- No location data
- No contacts, photos, or other personal files
- No advertising identifiers or ad tracking
- No data is shared with third parties for advertising or marketing purposes

## Third-Party Services

The app uses the following third-party services:

- **Firebase Analytics** for anonymous usage analytics
- **Firebase Firestore** for receiving voluntary user feedback

No other third-party SDKs are included.

## Children's Privacy

This app does not knowingly collect personal information from children. The app contains no ads, no in-app purchases, and no account creation.

## Data Retention

Study progress is stored on your device for as long as the app is installed. Feedback submissions are retained on our servers for the purpose of improving the app and may be deleted periodically.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the updated effective date at the top of this page.
